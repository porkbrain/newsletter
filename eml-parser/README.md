# `eml-parser`
Parses email to text. The library which performs this function is more reliable
than analogically Rust crates.

`eml-parser` [listens to an SQS message][s3-to-sqs] of newly stored S3 objects.
It fetches the object and uses [mailparser][mailparser] to extract body from the
MIME file.  If everything is as expected we store the email information in a
database and the email HTML into another S3 bucket. This action triggers next
service in line, the `prtsc`.

## S3 email key
We store the S3 bucket object name in db. The S3 object name is a random string
generated by the SES when storing the email as a file or hash of the email (for
example: `7gfmhp045dv9hfst94stsrfr8mieseafn6b0ce01`). It is used throughout the
system for identification of single newsletter.

## Test
```bash
npm t

npm run integration-tests
```
